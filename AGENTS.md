## Project Vision
- Whispers of the Forgotten Vale is a gentle, atmospheric text adventure.
- Focus on story, exploration, and subtle interactivity.

## Coding Standards
- Use C++17 or newer.
- Keep functions small and focused.
- Prefer explicit code over clever one-liners for readability.

## AI/Codex Instructions
- Add new features in separate branches with clear PRs.
- Never refactor core input parser without explicit instructions.
- Always keep main.cpp compiling and playable.
- When adding dialogue or descriptions, maintain the poetic and mysterious tone.
- Comment complex or non-obvious logic.

## Do Not Touch
- Do not overwrite save/load code without approval.
- Avoid adding external dependencies unless requested.

## Future TODOs
- NPC's
- NPC interactions
- Quests
- Puzzles/Riddles
- Specific item uses (Key for a locked door, herbs for healing, lump of iron for a quest etc.)
- Dynamic weather
- Room visit history
- Save/Load system

## Tone
- Use British English for text output.
- Avoid Americanisms.
